# licenses-and-restrictions
A repository to develop cross-domain recommendations for communicating licenses and restrictions. Properties for describing the conditions of access and usage, based on ODRL and other common vocabularies.

There is a [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T0k4qA5vvwv9yRvxMnZZFAD2sRqTCQR0?usp=drive_link) that might contain related documents.  Recommended practice is to keep documents here in Githup.
